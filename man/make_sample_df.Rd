\title{Create a Data Frame of Peak Amplitudes and Percentages}
\usage{
make_sample_df(sample_sanger)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample_sanger}{A \code{sangerseq} object typically created
from an ABIF file using \code{sangerseqR::sangerseq}.}
}
\value{
A \code{tibble} (data frame) with one row per base call
  position, containing:
  \itemize{
    \item Peak locations for A, C, G, T.
    \item \code{max_base}: The primary called base.
    \item \code{A_area} to \code{T_area}: The peak height (area).
    \item \code{A_perc} to \code{T_perc}: The relative percentage
      of each base's area compared to the sum of all four areas.
    \item \code{position}: The sequential base call index.
  }
}
\description{
Extracts and processes base-call information from a \code{sangerseq}
object to create a data frame containing peak area, location, and
relative percentage for all four bases (A, C, G, T) at every called
position. The base that was not called at a position is assigned the
area value of the highest-called base at that same trace location.

\examples{
# This example requires an ABIF file to be available.
# path_to_abif <- "path/to/your/sanger_file.ab1"
# sanger_data <- sangerseqR::read.abif(path_to_abif)
# sanger_object <- sangerseqR::sangerseq(sanger_data)
# df <- make_sample_df(sanger_object)
