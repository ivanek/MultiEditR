\title{Plot Editing Statistics in Tested Wild-Type Bases}
\usage{
plot_editing_barplot(fit)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{The \code{list} object resulting from a base editor
analysis function (e.g., \code{detect_edits}), which contains
the intermediate processed data in the \code{output_sample_alt}
slot.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object: a bar plot where the bars show
  the **mean percent height** of the edited base, grouped by
  whether the edit was statistically significant (\code{sig}).
  Individual data points are shown, and the plot is faceted by
  the specific edited base (\code{base}).
}
\description{
Generates a \code{ggplot} bar plot visualizing the mean percentage
height of the edited base (e.g., T for C-to-T) at all targeted
wild-type positions. Points for individual base positions are
overlaid, and the data is faceted by the edited base.
}
\examples{
# This requires a full analysis result object, 'fit', from a
# function like detect_edits().
# plot_editing_barplot(fit_object)
