\title{Determine if Reverse Complement of Control Sequence is a Better Alignment}
\usage{
is_revcom_ctrl_better(init_sample_seq, init_ctrl_seq)
}
\arguments{
\item{init_sample_seq}{A \code{character} string or \code{DNAString}
object representing the sample sequence.}

\item{init_ctrl_seq}{A \code{character} string or \code{DNAString}
object representing the control sequence.}
}
\value{
A \code{logical} value: \code{TRUE} if the alignment score
  with the reverse complement of the control sequence is strictly
  greater than the score with the forward control sequence, and
  \code{FALSE} otherwise.
}
\description{
Compares the alignment score of the sample sequence against the
control sequence with the alignment score of the sample sequence
against the **reverse complement** of the control sequence.
}
\examples{
# Assume 'revcom' function is available
# Best match is forward:
# is_revcom_ctrl_better("ATGC", "ATGC")
# # Expected: FALSE

# Best match is reverse complement:
# is_revcom_ctrl_better("ATGC", "GCAT")
# # Expected: TRUE
}
