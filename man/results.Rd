\title{Get Complete Base Editor Fit Results}
\usage{
results(fit)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{A \code{list} object, the result of a base editor
analysis function like \code{detect_edits}, containing both
raw and intermediate processed data.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} containing the following columns:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{raw_sample_position}: Position in the sample sanger
      sequence.
    \item \code{passed_trimming}: \code{TRUE} if the sample sanger
      sequence passed quality trimming, \code{FALSE} otherwise.
    \item \code{motif_number}: The numbered motif match in the
      control sequence. \code{-1} for no match, \code{1} for the
      first match, etc.
    \item \code{edit_sig}: \code{TRUE} if the wild-type base was
      significantly changed based on the adjusted p-value.
    \item \code{control_base}: The primary base call from the control
      sequence. Also serves as the expected motif base when
      \code{motif_number > 0}.
    \item \code{expected_change}: The expected nucleotide change
      (e.g., "C->T") at that position.
    \item \code{sample_primary_call}: The highest defined peak in the
      sample sequence.
    \item \code{sample_secondary_call}: The second highest defined
      peak in the sample sequence.
    \item \code{A_area} to \code{T_area}: The maximum sample height
      of each base peak.
    \item \code{A_perc} to \code{T_perc}: The percent of each base
      peak's height over the sum of all base heights.
    \item \code{edit_pvalue}: The raw p-value for the base edit.
    \item \code{edit_padjust}: The Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted
      p-value for the base edit.
    \item \code{motif_seq}: The motif sequence used for alignment.
      If the reverse complement was used, this is the rev-com sequence.
    \item \code{sample_file}: The file name of the sample sequence.
    \item \code{control_file}: The file name of the control sequence.
  }

\description{
Consolidates the raw sequencing data and the edit detection
results into a single comprehensive data frame for final output.

\examples{
# This requires a full analysis result object, 'fit', from a
# function like detect_edits().
# final_results <- results(fit_object)
